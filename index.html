      <h1>The Next World</h1>

    <div align="justify">
<p>
A group game including god and the devil and can be played by all ages.
      </p><p>
The winner is the one who moves the last man to the highest temple in heaven.
</p><p>
This is what you’ll learn to do: enter and exit, rise and raise, transform, power and empower, give and transform, close and trust. 
</p><p>
To enter: from the nothing to the world. 
To exit: from this world to heaven or hell. 
To rise: a level
To raise: your enemy
To transform: from heaven to hell and from hell to heaven. 
To power: the one who wins saves all the worlds. 
To empower: the one who doesn’t. “You are just like him except you come from the hidden light.” And the one who always loses even though he tries hardest is the hidden light himself and all the righteous and the messiah himself receive their light from him.
To give: the power to choose between good and bad. 
To transform: something to nothing. 
Close: your eyes
Trust: the other players.
</p><p>
And the entire game is a combination of these basic moves.

      <h3>About the CEO in the vision of 2020</h3>
<p>
As far as I can remember, my problems started thinking I was the messiah and that I can control the weather, when predicting the wind and the rain, this can be confusing, believe me these are small problems compared to the problems created by psychiatric protocol and medicine, a system that is supposed to get you mentaly better only causes a copious amount of other mental problems. Yes, they were able to delete the thought of that me being the messiah but did this by crushing my personality, feeling unaccepted, isolated, emptiness and void, I still want to reach the level of a messiah even though I am not the one who will redeem the world and like it says in psalms: "Don't touch my messiahs" , messiahs in plural meaning every one can reach the level of the messiah even though there is only one who can save the world.

one of my best kept secrets is that I can hear g-ds voice in my mind and I have conversations with him like a best friend, fortunately for me when I asked my rabbi if this was truth or imagination he told me that it comes from the truth and even better then that I was fortunate to meet more people like me except they are defined as normal (or suffering from the unspecified disorder disorder which is the next big thing in the DSM; Everybody is going to be on medication :)). It was very interesting to see the transformation of this voice from imagination to reality and I couldn’t talk about this with the doctors since I was afraid of their reaction and the repercussions this could cause me by the power given to psychiatrists by law and I think the world should follow Norway opening medication free wards and hospitals.

I was born in Glasgow, Scotland 1977 and made aliya when I was less than a year old with my older brother and parents. I grew up in a secular family even though my Dad seemed to enjoy seeing us tormented by ritual on some occasions going to synagogue on Shabbat. I went through school spending most of my time at the beach or away from the teachers, I enjoyed studying but needed to learn at my own pace so I turned to books. When I was 19 it was time for the army where I served and a team commander and drill sergeant in the artillery brigade. After the army I started experimenting with psychoactives. I was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder and spent most of my twenties recovering from psychiatric care. I got married with my lovely wife when I was 30 and my first child was born, today I have a Son (12) and a daughter (9). I spent my 30ies building my relationship with my wife and kids. At about 39 I travelled to Ukraine to visit the grave of rabbi Nachman and when I came back I decided to stop the medication which led me to another 4 years of mental struggle. In parallel to all of this I learnt how to program computers after the army, I had a couple of Jobs in startup companies and developed a 20 year carrier leading me to be an infrastructure engineer in a leading software company, I also studied optics in university during my 30ties and am currently trying to startup a company with a special device I have invented that might cure the blind and currently working on a book called: "The pleasure of pain".

The Next World arose from my desire to combine chess and backgammon, I hope you enjoy it.

And paranoid schizophrenia is a genus and the hidden light in one and this is the majority of the population and hell is only a small branch of depression and the way out is to ask for faith a lot without end. And psychiatrists are paranoid from lunatics.
